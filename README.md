# Reactor ☢️

App where you can add reactions to a web page. 

As a user, I should be able to click anywhere on the page and react with an emoji and an optional comment. While rescaling the page, the reaction should stay put.

Focus on creating something good-looking, **delightful to use,** and adding fun details or features!
